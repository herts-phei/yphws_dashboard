# YPHWS Dashboard

## About the survey

This dashboard shows data from the annual Young People’s Health & Wellbeing Survey (YPHWS) at Hertfordshire level. The Young People’s Health & Wellbeing Survey (YPHWS) is an anonymous online survey which gathers self-reported information annually from those aged 11-19 in Hertfordshire. The survey includes questions about home life, wellbeing, diet, physical activity, smoking, alcohol use, drug use, sexual health, mental health, bullying, and safety. The project is funded by Hertfordshire Public Health and YC Hertfordshire and is run by the Public Health Evidence & Intelligence Team and provides an opportunity for partnership working between organisations providing services to young people around the county.

The survey has been ongoing for two years with good uptake: 12,923 responses in the first year and 11,681 responses in the second. The data in this dashboard is expected to update annually during spring with the latest survey data, collected during November - December in the previous year. Please note that additional questions/indicators may be added in response to health concerns during the time of the survey (e.g. COVID-19). For more information about the survey and supporting reports, please visit the [YPHWS page](https://www.hertshealthevidence.org/yphws/what-is-the-yphws.aspx) on the Herts Health Evidence website.
